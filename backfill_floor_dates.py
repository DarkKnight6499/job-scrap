"""One-off: recover real dates for queue entries stamped with the pre-fix Workday "30+ Days Ago"
floor artifact - _workday_posted() used to compute today-minus-30 for that bucket and store it as
if it were exact, so any entry whose posted date sits exactly 29 or 30 days before its first_seen
is almost certainly that fake floor date, not a real one (a real 30th-day match happening on the
exact day it was first seen, every time, would be an absurd coincidence at this volume - see the
327/100-entry spikes on the two floor dates found in the queue).

Re-fetches each flagged entry's Workday detail endpoint (same path as backfill_posted.py's
Workday branch) to recover the real startDate. Whatever still can't be recovered (closed/gated
posting, 403/404) is set to "" (unknown) rather than left holding the fake floor date - unknown
is honest, a specific-looking wrong date is not.

Run once from the repo root: py -3 backfill_floor_dates.py
