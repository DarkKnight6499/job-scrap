"""One-off: fill in `posted` on queue.json entries that predate the field being added to
_process_company() (or, for Workday, that predate describe() capturing the detail endpoint's
exact startDate - see job_scout.describe()/_workday_detail_posted()).

Two recovery paths:
  - Workday entries go through describe(), which hits the per-job DETAIL endpoint. That's what
    carries the exact startDate; the bulk listing that FETCH[] uses omits postedOn entirely for
    some tenants (confirmed: Ares) and only gives a floored "30+ Days Ago" bucket for others.
    Throttled (one request at a time, brief pause) since Workday 429s on concurrency bursts -
    see the comment on describe_pool in job_scout.run().
  - Every other ATS already returns an exact date from its bulk list call (Greenhouse
    first_published, Lever createdAt, Ashby publishedAt, SmartRecruiters releasedDate, Oracle
    PostedDate), so the original re-fetch-the-listing-and-match-by-id approach still applies.

A posting no longer live (filled/pulled - detail endpoint 404s, or the id isn't in the current
bulk listing) has no way to recover its date and is left as "unknown" - a real limitation, not
a bug.
